Just to remind where I am
-------------------------

So now I am able to load the generated js into the visualization page
using iframe. Now the problem is that if I put the varSumTrace variable 
directly into the skulpt.js file the embedding_demo.html reads it fine
and renders everything properly but when I replace the varSumTrace with
some of my own trace the embedding_demo.html is unable to locate it.
