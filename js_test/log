What I just did is loading an iframe on button click.
Next I should simply have skulpt as the main page and then when the run button 
would be pressed the new iframe will be loaded with the OPT page as source.
And we will just need to access the variable in the skulpt.js from the iframe 
page just don't know how.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imported skulpt.js in embedding-demo.html. Skulpt.js is having the listSumTrace
variable (line 12533) and also deleted the variable from embedding-demo.js. 
Put the embedding-demo.html as an iframe in calling_from_js.html. 

So what we can do now is that have the variable in skulpt.js and call it from
embedding-demo.html.
